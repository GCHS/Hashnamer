# Hashnamer
Calculates the MD5 of every file in a folder, puts files with the same hashes in the Recycle Bin, and renames the files with their MD5 hashes

It takes each folder to work on as a command line argument. You can also drag'n'drop a folder onto the executable. To try and contain damage from any accidents, Hashnamer does not work recursively; it will not work on any folders inside the ones you pass to it. It has no flags.
